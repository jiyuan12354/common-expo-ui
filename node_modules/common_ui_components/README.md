## for developers

we initialted several npm scripts to speed up our develop workflow

1. `yarn gen:icon`: generate or update iconfont components, before run this script, make sure you put (iconfont.ttf, iconfont.css) in `app/components/icon-font/fonts` folder

2.  `yarn gen:translate`: generate or update translations, before run this script, make sure you put the latest language files in `app/translation` folder

3.  `yarn start`: this is different with `yarn start:nochache`, it just update your current workspace's code to exop example project, expo will quickly start, because it will not to download all npm libraries from remote registry.

4. `yarn sync`: this script is similar with `yarn start`, it just copy your current workspace's code to exop example project, if you already running expo example project, this script can update the app and no need to restart project

5. `yarn sync:back`: sometimes we may just update code on `examples/common-expo-ui/node_modules/common_ui_components` directly, this script will be helpful when we want to copy our updates in node_bodules back to our git workspace
    > Because common_ui_components repo is a bare repo, it jsut has peerDependencies instead of dependencies or devDependencies.
    So at this case, if we directly write code on this bare repo, we will have no `Auto imports` and lose some `Syntax highlighting and semantic highlighting`
